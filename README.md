Just some ideas on the firefighting app and schiz. [via the Gdoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrrKja9VxnZDaA6_mjLC2-40guvXCysXzSgjufWawxI/edit)

**Architecture**

I have no idea how to develop native iphone/android/whatever apps. Think it would be simpler to do this with a webapp.

- [Express?](http://expressjs.com/)
- [SMS via Node-google-voice?](https://github.com/amper5and/node-google-voice#readme)
- [Mapping via Leaflet?](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/)
- OSM

**Questions**

How is the dispatcher going to send data? Another web app? If it's an address, does that mean we have to geocode?
